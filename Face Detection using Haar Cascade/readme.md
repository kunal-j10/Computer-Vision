# Face Detection Using Haar Cascade

### Detecting Faces using  OpenCV (Python library) and a pre-trained model for Face Detection **"Haar Cascade"** 

### **Haar Cascade** is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.

### **Positive images –** These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.

### **Negative Images –** Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.



> Here we are using [haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml](https://github.com/kunal-j10/Computer-Vision/blob/main/Face%20Detection%20using%20Haar%20Cascade/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) for Face detection , we can also use various [haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) according to our needs .
